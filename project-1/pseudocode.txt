Minesweeper

default page will be beginner mode (8 x 8 gridded divs)
will have intermediate mode and expert mode options that can be set in preferences
will have preferences tab at the top
    when clicked, board will hide and preferences page will show up (toggle method?)
    you can change game board size with mode choices using the radio input elements.
    Mode choices will have a default number of mines
    you can also change number of mines with a number input box
    there will be a red reset board button and a green resume playing button
        resume will be pretty easy because it will basically just ignore whatever was inputted in prefs ...and show the board again
        the reset board button will re-render a new board of specified size and (optional mines)
        (for usability, I will also add an x button to the top right corner which will behave the same as  ..the resume playing button)

help tab with gameplay objectives and hints will be added if I have time 

going to lean heavily on original design for the structure of the game elements, 
    will add my own styling after I get the javascript to work...

top of board will have:
    mines left count
    smiley face that will change based on win-state
        smile if no winner or loser yet
        sunglasses if player wins
        X'ed eyes if player loses
    seconds ticker

**************
JS pseudocode:
constants
    colors that will be applied based on the board number
    number of rows and columns for each mode
    default number of mines for each mode

state variables
    mode
    number of mines placed in board
    number of mines unmarked
    playerStatus won/lost/playing
    time displayed on ticker
    board array values = 0, or 1-8, or mine (don't know what to use for this value yet)
    board tiles revealed/hidden

cache (will add as necessary once i start coding)
preferences tab
    mode buttons
    set num mines input
    reset, resume buttons
mines left count viewer
smiley
time ticker
gameboard

JS:
initialize board
    beginner mode
    number of mines based on default
    set up array with 
have event listeners listening for clicks (will be specific to right or left click!)
    preferences button
    reset button
        get mode
        get number of mines
        set up array with size based on mode
        randomly throw mines into the array
        calculate numbers in array based on where the mines are in array
        render board based on state variables
will start the timer after first successful click on board
render based on type of click,
    left-click will basically rerender the clicked div from back of tile to number/blank space
    have logic to flip connected blank tiles if left-clicked
check winner
display winner stuff

If I have time...
replay button after gameplay has finished
explosion sound when mine is hit
    ripple animation when mine is hit
    scanner animation when player wins
help tab
X button on preferences tab





****** questions ******
How do i rerender the ticker for each second that has elapsed? (not based on clicks or anything to re-render).
-can you set a timer that runs inside javascript?
